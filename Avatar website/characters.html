                Jake Sully (born August 24, 2126) is the protagonist of Avatar. He is a paraplegic renegade Marine veteran who defects to the Na'vi race and is also one of the 20 known avatar drivers. He is the sixth Toruk Makto and Olo'eyktan of the Omaticaya clan.<br>
                After his twin brother, Tom, was killed on Earth, Jake agreed to replace him in the Avatar Program on Pandora, in which humans remotely control human/Na'vi hybrids to safely navigate the planet. He was originally assigned to gather intel that would help Colonel Quaritch find a way to force the Na'vi to leave Hometree, or destroy it if necessary. The Na'vi occupation of Hometree was blocking the RDA's access to a very large deposit of unobtanium underneath the tree.

                  Neytiri te Tskaha Mo'at’ite is the Na'vi princess of the Omaticaya clan. She is the second-born daughter of Eytukan and Mo'at and younger sister of Sylwanin. She meets Jake Sully in a Pandoran forest, helping him when he is attacked by a pack of viperwolves. Neytiri soon becomes Jake's teacher and helps him to complete several tasks. Eventually, they fall in love and mate under the Trees of Voices. Neytiri fights alongside Jake in the Assault on the Tree of Souls and saves him from being killed by Miles Quaritch. She will be the future Tsahìk of the clan, with her mate, Jake, as Olo'eyktan.<br>
                  As Neytiri guides Jake through the forest, Tsu'tey and his cavalry of hunters ambush Jake, but Neytiri intervenes and explains that there has been a sign from Eywa and that Mo'at, the Tsahìk of the clan and Neytiri's mother, should decide Jake's fate. Escorting Jake to see Mo'at and the clan leader and Neytiri's father, Eytukan, the latter becomes angry at the fact that Neytiri brought Jake to Hometree because he had expressly forbidden humans from entering his people's land.

                  Colonel Miles Quaritch was the principal antagonist of Avatar. He served as the chief of security at Hell's Gate on Pandora.
                  Having no regard for indigenous lifeforms, especially the Na'vi, and considering them all expendable, he directed the destruction of the Omaticaya Hometree and led the SecOps forces in an attempt to destroy the Tree of Souls.
                  He was killed when Neytiri shot him twice through the chest with her father's bow.
                  On his first day on Pandora, an encounter with the wildlife dealt him a trio of trademark scars to the right side of his head and face. Given the option to return home for reconstructive surgery he opted to stay on Pandora. With his impressive record, he was eventually chosen as the chief of security of Hell's Gate.

                  Eytukan was the patriarch of the Omaticaya clan, the mate of Mo'at, the father of Neytiri and Sylwanin, and the father-in-law of Jake Sully. Eytukan was responsible for the overall leadership of the Omaticaya clan on Pandora during the RDA occupation. Under his and Mo'at's instructions, their daughter, Neytiri, trained Jake Sully in the lifestyle of the Na'vi. He was killed during the Destruction of The Hometree by falling wood, which impaled him through the chest. His great-grandfather was the fifth Toruk Makto, the sixth being Jake. <br>
         After a sign from Eywa, Neytiri took Jake Sully to Hometree to be judged by her father and her mother. At first, Eytukan was angered by Jake's presence as he had forbade all humans from entering Hometree after his eldest daughter, Sylwanin, and many other children were killed by humans. But after an inspection from Mo'at, he began to show an interest in him.
